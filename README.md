## Notes

* To do a database dump using rake, type in your terminal from the project root folder: `rake dump\["train_system"\]`.
* To do a database dump without rake, `pg_dump [name of database] > database_backup.sql` in root directory
* To create database first enter psql then `CREATE DATABASE [name];`
* `\c [name of database]`
* Make schema, `CREATE TABLE [name of table] (column_name datatype, ...);`
* Make all tables you need, don't forget join table!!
* To check schema `\d [database name]`
* `CREATE DATABASE [name of test database] WITH TEMPLATE [name of main database you just created];`
* if you get an error in psql, check for semicolon!!
